Here’s a detailed explanation of how the **mean**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** were calculated step by step:

---

### **1. Mean (\( \bar{X} \))**

The formula for the mean of grouped data is:

\[
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum(f \cdot X)}{\sum f}
\]

Where:
- \( f \) = frequency
- \( X \) = midpoint of the class interval

**Steps**:
1. Compute the midpoint (\( X \)) of each class interval: 
   - \( X = \frac{\text{Lower Bound} + \text{Upper Bound}}{2} \)

   Example for the first interval (10–15):
   \[
   X = \frac{10 + 15}{2} = 12.5
   \]

2. Multiply each midpoint (\( X \)) by its frequency (\( f \)): 
   - \( f \cdot X \)

3. Sum up all the \( f \cdot X \) values:
   \[
   \sum(f \cdot X) = 37.5 + 18.5 + 98.0 + 152.5 + 73.0 + 212.5 = 592.0
   \]

4. Sum up all the frequencies (\( f \)):
   \[
   \sum f = 3 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 20
   \]

5. Divide \( \sum(f \cdot X) \) by \( \sum f \):
   \[
   \bar{X} = \frac{592.0}{20} = 29.6
   \]

---

### **2. Variance (\( \sigma^2 \))**

The formula for variance is:

\[
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2)}{\sum f}
\]

Where:
- \( X \) = midpoint
- \( \bar{X} \) = mean
- \( f \) = frequency

**Steps**:
1. Calculate \( (X - \bar{X})^2 \) for each class:
   - Example for the first class (10–15, midpoint = 12.5):
   \[
   (12.5 - 29.6)^2 = (-17.1)^2 = 292.41
   \]

2. Multiply \( (X - \bar{X})^2 \) by the frequency (\( f \)):
   - \( f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2 \)

   Example for the first class:
   \[
   3 \cdot 292.41 = 877.23
   \]

3. Sum up all \( f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2 \) values:
   \[
   \sum(f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2) = 877.23 + 123.21 + 104.04 + 4.05 + 95.22 + 832.05 = 2035.8
   \]

4. Divide the result by \( \sum f \):
   \[
   \sigma^2 = \frac{2035.8}{20} = 101.79
   \]

---

### **3. Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \))**

The formula for standard deviation is:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
\]

**Steps**:
1. Take the square root of the variance:
   \[
   \sigma = \sqrt{101.79} = 10.09
   \]

   X = \frac{10 + 15}{2} = 12.5
   \]

   \]

4. Sum up all the frequencies (\( f \)):
   \[
   \sum f = 3 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 20

   \]

3. Sum up all \( f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2 \) values:
   \[
   \sum(f \cdot (X - \bar{X})^2) = 877.23 + 123.21 + 104.04 + 4.05 + 95.22 + 832.05 = 2035.8
   \]

4. Divide the result by \( \sum f \):
   \[
